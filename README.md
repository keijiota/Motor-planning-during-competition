# Optimizing motor decision-making through competition with opponents

This repository accompanies the manusript by Ota et al., (2019), accepted in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. It includes subject's data and the scripts for generating figures reported in the paper.

# Overview of the data structure
The data structure is as follows:
<li>endpoint: subject's endpoint in each trial. The number of trials is different among experiments (see Figure 2). For example, there are 50 trials (baseline), 120 trials (competition), and 50trials (washout) in Experiment 1a & 1b. </li>
<li>endpoint_com: computer's endpoint in each trial. Since this is computer's endpoint, the data only exists from 51st to 170th trial. </li>
