# Optimizing motor decision-making through competition with opponents

This repository accompanies the manusript by Ota et al., (2019), accepted in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. It includes subject's data and the scripts for generating figures reported in the paper.

# Overview of the data structure
The data structure is as follows:
<li>endpoint: subject's endpoint in each trial. </li> 
The number of trials is different among experiments (see Figure 2). For example, there are 50 trials (baseline), 120 trials (competition), and 50trials (washout) in Experiment 1a & 1b. 

<li>endpoint_com: computer's endpoint in each trial.</li>
Since this is computer's endpoint, the data only exists from 51st to 170th trial.
